--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AMUN is a code to perform numerical simulations in a fluid approximation on
non-uniform (adaptive) meshes with and without magnetic field.  The goal in
developing this code is to create a solid framework for simulations on uniform
and adaptive meshes in the Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinate
systems with a number of numerical methods which can be selectable in an easy
manner. The code is completely written in Fortran 2003.

Developers
==========

 - Grzegorz Kowal <grzegorz@amuncode.org>


Requirements
============

 - GNU Fortran compiler 4.5 and newer (http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/)
 - HDF5 libraries 1.8 and newer (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)


Supported Compilers
===================

The code supports and has been tested with the following compilers:

GNU Fortran Version 4.5.x
Intel Fortran Compiler 11, 12, & 13
PathScale EKOPath(tm) Compiler Suite: Version 1.0.0


Preparation
===========

1)  Unpack the downloaded source archive or clone it.
2)  Go to 'src' directory.
3)  Copy 'make.default' to a new file 'make.config'.
4)  Modify file 'make.config' in order to change supported physics and methods.
5)  Go to 'hosts' directory.
6)  Copy file 'default' to a new file with your host name (has to be exactly
    the same name as returned by command 'hostname').
7)  Adjust compiler and compilation options in your new host file.
8)  Go up to 'src' directory.
9)  If the HDF5 libraries are not installed in the default location in your
    system (/usr), make sure that the environment variable 'HDF5DIR' is set
    in your .bashrc (or .cshrc) and pointing to the location where the HDF5
    libraries are installed.
10) Compile sources by typing 'make' in the command line in order to create
    the executable file 'amun.x'.


Usage
=====

First, prepare the parameter file.  By default this is 'params.in'.
The executable file supports a command line option '-i' to specify a different
parameter file name.  Without this option it assumes that parameters are read
from 'params.in'.  Example parameter files can be found in directory 'problems'.

In order to run serial version, just type 'amun.x' in the command line.

In order to run parallel version, type 'mpirun -n N ./amun.x', where N is the
number of processors.
